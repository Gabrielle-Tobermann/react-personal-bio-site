        <p>I was born and raised in a small town in France. Being both French and
          American, I decided to move to the United States when I turned 18. I love
          music and grew up learning violin. So, upon my arrival in Tennessee, I
          attended Middle Tennessee State University and graduated with a Bachelor
          of music with an out-of-state violin scholarship. I discovered programming
          through a friend, during my time at MTSU. My interest in coding kept
          growing as I was learning more about it. I realized that being a musician
          and programmer was a perfect combination. Both fields are challenging,
          require constant learning, and are extremely rewarding. I am now attending
          Nashville Software School to become a full-stack software developer.</p>
